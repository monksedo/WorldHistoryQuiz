// CODING CHALLENGE - BASIC CONSOLE QUIZ GAME
//
/*
1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question.A question should include:
a.Question itself
b.The multiple choises answers(Choose an adequate data structure here, array, object, etc.)
c.A correct answer(use number answer options)

2. Creat a couple of questions using the constructor

3. Store all question inside and array.

4. Select one random question and log it on the colole, together with the answers(Each question should start with a number ex: 1. Question; 2. Question...)

5. Use the prompt function to ask the user for the correct answer.The user should input the number of the correct answer such as you desplayed it on Task 4.

6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct or not(Hint: write another method for this).

7. Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in the code.So make sure that all your code is private and don't interfere with the other programmers code (Hint: we learned a special technique to do exactly that).

8. After you display the result, display the next random question, so that a game never ends (Hint: write a function for this and call it right after displaying the result).

9. Be careful: After Task 8, the game literally never ends. so include the option to quit the game if the user writes 'exit' instead of the answer. In this case, don't call the function from task 8.

10. Track the user's score to make the game more fun! So each time an answer is correct, and 1 point to the score (Hint: I am going to use the power of closures for this, but you don't have to, just do this with the tools you feel more comfortable at this point).

11. Display the score in the console. Use yet another method for this.
